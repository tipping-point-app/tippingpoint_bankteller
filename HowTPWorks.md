HOW IT WORKS

Tipping Point is a crowdfunding and fundraising app built on Base, an Ethereum layer-two network.

Campaign creators set certain requirements (like a minimum amount of money to raise and/or a minimum number of attendees) along with a deadline for invitees to opt-in.

If the requirements are met before the deadline, the campaign "tips" and Tipping Point automatically transfers funds from those who joined to the campaign creator. Tipping Point takes a small fee (1.5%) for this service (from the contributors, in addition to their campaign contribution).

If the requirements aren't met before the deadline, nothing happens and no fees are charged.

TIPPING POINT CAMPAIGNS

There are four types of Tipping Point campaigns, based on the requirements creators want to set.

The first two, Split Fixed Amount and Fixed Amount Per Person, result in every contributor paying the same amount. The number of contributors is often capped (but not necessarily), e.g. for in-person events.

The latter two, Goal-Based Fundraising and Flexible Fundraising, are fundraising options where users can contribute whatever amount they'd like.

1. Split Fixed Amount campaigns are for when you need a specific amount of money, regardless of the number of contributors.

The final price per person will change depending on how many contributors opt in. As more people join, the cost per person goes down.

Examples:

-Booking a vacation home to share with friends
-Renting a venue (like a restaurant, ballroom, or community center) for a party or event
-Group activities like boat rentals, taxis, or party busses where the companies charge a flat group rate
-Crowdfunding a project with a predefined startup cost, like a business venture or construction project

2. Fixed Amount Per Person campaigns are for when the price per person is set from the start, and you just need to ensure a minimum number of people participate.

Examples:

-Buying or selling tickets to a concert, performance, or sporting event (venues can ensure a profitable attendance; attendees can book rows or sections with friends)
-Hiring a chef or caterer for a group event (there's often a set price per guest, but a minimum number of guests required)
-Booking people like tour guides, tutors, or yoga teachers where the instructor charges per person

3. Goal-Based Fundraisers are all-or-nothing campaigns for when you need to raise at least a minimum amount of money for the project to happen.

Goal-Based Fundraisers can still raise more than that, but won't tip unless they reach their minimum.

Examples:

-Funding a construction project
-Starting a small business or launching a product
-Producing a film, album, or other creative work
-Funding scientific research projects or expeditions

4. Flexible Fundraisers have no minimums - the campaign will tip as long as there's at least one contribution.

Examples:

-Crowdfunding medical expenses
-Fundraising for disaster relief/humanitarian aid
-Collecting donations for charities and non-profits
-Funding campaigns for personal projects or creative works with no fixed budget
-Crowdfunding things like honeymoons, adoption fees, etc.

WEB3

Tipping Point uses a series of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to transfer funds between users, providing several unique and important benefits:

Seizure Resistance: Funds are always self-custodied by users in their wallets. Tipping Point smart contracts merely route contributions from contributors to campaign creators when a campaign tips; Tipping Point never has access to or takes possession of user funds.

Censorship Resistance and Privacy: Tipping Point doesn't require any personal or financial information to set up an account and has no way of stopping a transaction once it's been submitted to the Ethereum network. 

Users can simply connect their wallets and start using Tipping Point - no personal data or permission required.

Data Security: Because Tipping Point doesn't require users to provide sensitive data, that information is never at risk of being abused or stolen.

Phone numbers and email addresses are optional, and only used to enhance the Tipping Point experience (users can receive text and email notifications; find friends on the app more easily; opt-in to additional Tipping Point communications; etc.).

Instant Settlement: Tipping Point eliminates financial intermediaries (like banks, credit card companies, and payment processors) and instead connects users directly to their peers on the blockchain.

Like Ethereum, Tipping Point runs 24/7/365 - no more waiting days for payments to settle or for the bank to open. Once a campaign tips, creators can collect their funds immediately.

Lowest Fees: By cutting out the middlemen, Tipping Point can offer the lowest crowdfunding fees out there: a mere 1.5% (and users only pay fees for campaigns that tip). No risk, all reward!
